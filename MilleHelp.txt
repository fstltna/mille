One starts with six cards, and draws a new one before each turn (keeping the
total seven). The object of the game is to first reach 700 miles, by playing
cards with numbers. One can sabotage the opponent by playing cards like 'Speed
Limit' and 'Accident', in which case he will have to use 'End of Limit' and
'Repairs'. If he does not have these cards, or the appropriate protection card,
he will have to discard a card instead of playing it until he gets one he can
play.
